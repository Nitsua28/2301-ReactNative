## S3 - Simple Storage Service
- Host files/documents online
- Different than RDS because RDS is a lot more structured
    - RDS has schemas, tables, rows, columns
    - S3 has buckets which let us upload documents such as images, files, videos, HTML web pages
- We will use S3 to host our front-end applications

### Object Ownership
- If we want to host our website, the files need to be publicly accessible
- When creating the bucket, we want to select ACLs enabled which will give us control over how we allocate visibility to our objects
- Once we upload an object, we can click it
    - Select Actions -> Make public using ACL

### Public Access
- We want to turn off Block Public Access so public access is allowed

### Static Site:
- Go to properties tab
- Scroll to the bottom
- Edit Static Website Hosting
- Enable it
- Fill out the fields for index.html and error.html to specify where the main page and what page will show up if error

### Uploading React Projects
- First, run npm run build to build our project
- Then, upload all of the files in the build folder
- Then upload the static folder
- Enable the static website hosting
    - Keep in mind that until we host our back-end, we'll see that the site won't be fully functional because it won't be able to access the back-end

### Delete Bucket
- First empty out all of the objects
- Then we can delete

### Exercise
- Create a React project or use a previous project
- Build it and upload to S3 static site
- Send me the link
