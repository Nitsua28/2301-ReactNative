## H2 Database
- The reason we learned about databases is so we could persist data between runs of the application
- But this raises an issue with testing DAO methods
    - Imagine trying to write a consistent test that interacts with a database that could be in a different state each time
    - When testing the service, we could just mock the DAO layer
        - This works fine for Service layer and we should use still use mocking for the Service layer
    - If we're testing the DAO layer, we'll need some way to keep the database in an expected way
- The solution is an H2 database which is in memory
    - Meaning the database gets reset every time we restart the program, making sure our DAO tests can be consistent

### Setting Up
1. Put the dependency in pom.xml
2. Edit our .properties (assuming we're in a Spring Boot application)
```
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=password
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
```
