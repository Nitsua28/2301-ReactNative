# git

- The problem
  - **Keeping track of software edits and code is very difficult**
  - Code changes all the time
  - Newly added code can break old features
  - Multiple are often adding files or editing files
- ***All software code is literally fancy text files***
  - There is nothing special about your .js file
  - It is functionally identical to a .txt file

# Git as a solution
- git is ***Version Control Software/System*** VCS
  - It is a system for making changes to files and folder and tracking those changes
  
### Keywords
- **Repository**
  - Is a folder containing files and folders
  - **Remote Repository**
    - A centralized location for files and folders
    - The remote repository is the source of truth that everyone will work off of and contribute to
  - **Local Respository**
    - A **COPY** of the remote reposity on your local machine/computer
    - You directly make changes to the local repository
      - For instance by directly editing files in VS code


### Important commands
- Copy the remote repo to your local machine
```bash
git clone https://repolocation
```
```mermaid

        RemoteRepo --clone--> LocalRepo
```

- If you make a change or add a file to your local repo you use git add .
- Puts all changes into a staging area
```bash
git add .
``` 
- if you are confident in your changes you do git commit
```bash
git commit -m "some message"
```
- if you want put your local repo version and add put it on the remote repo you use git push
```bash
git push
```
### Important Notes
- .git folder is hidden
  - Contains a record of edits and transactions
  - You never need to access this
  - Whenever you run git commands *OTHER* than git clone you want to be in the directory that has this .git folder

### Statuses
- U Untracked
  - The file is in the local repository but **NOT** in the remote repository
- A Added
  - The file is in the **staging area** in the local repository but still not in the remote repository
- M Modified
  - The file exists in the remote repository but the local version of that file has been edited
