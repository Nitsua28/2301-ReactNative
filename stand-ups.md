## Stand-Ups
- Daily meeting where you meet with your team
    - In the case of project 2, it's a breakout room of your peers
- Bring up the following points:
    - What did you work since the last stand-up meeting
        - ex: Setting up Repo
        - ex: Finished a feature and submitted a pull request
    - What technical or non-technical blockers are you facing?
        - ex: Someone's work isn't finished yet so you can't test your feature fully
        - ex: Having trouble getting a function to work, etc.
    - What do I want to work on next
        - ex: Work with Rick to get the next feature done
