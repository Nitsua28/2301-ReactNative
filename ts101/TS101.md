# TypeScript

## Problem
- JS has *a lot* of issues
  - type coercion leads to unexpected types
  - There is a lack of intellisense when coding JS
    - Beacuse technically anything goes in JS
  - really easy to call functions with incorrect parameters or the wrong types
  - lack errors
    - values just being undefined and hiding the program
- JS is the only langauge supported in web browsers

## Solution
- Create a language that has the the type checking developer friendly validation
  - The language ***Transpiles*** itself into JavaScript
- ***TypeScript***
  - A statically typed version of JS
  - TypeScript and be transpiled into JS

### Features of TypeScript
- Static typing
  - can create variables of a certain type
  - can define return values
  - define generics for things like arrays
- Transpile into any version of JS
  - You can write code in the most modern syntax available and target old versions of JS
  - example
    - Write using TS classes and write a functionally equivalent version for ES3 that came out in 2006
- Has a lot more OOP
  - access modifiers
  - Classes before ES6
    - TS is from 2012
- ***Superset of JavaScript**
  - *any valid JS is valid TS*
  - TypeScript has additional features
- TypeScript is a **configurable programming language**
  - you voluntariliy opt in to certain features or syntaxes on a per project basis
  - ***tsconfig.json***
    - The file responsible for setting the options when you transpile a TS file into a JS file
- the `tsc` command will use the tsconfig.json to transpile all the TS files in the project into runnable JS
